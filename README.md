# GEOM2159-Geospatial-Programming
Major Project for Geospatial Programming 2019. To run this code the following files are needed:
Trees_reduced.shp, AOI.shp. File directory will also need to be changed. The tree point files were orignally much larger however it caused heavy lag in QGIS. Therefore I reduced the number of points in the tree point file.
